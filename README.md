# Bike Sharing Assignment
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes. Business Goal:
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 


## Table of Contents
To effectively model the demand for shared bikes and assist BoomBikes in strategizing for post-pandemic recovery, we will follow this structured approach:

Data Cleaning and Preparation

Handle missing values, if any.
Convert categorical variables into dummy variables.
Check for multicollinearity and remove highly correlated predictors if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize the distribution of the target variable ('cnt').
Explore the relationship between the target variable and potential predictors (e.g., season, weather, temperature).
Model Building

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Build a multiple linear regression model using the training set.
Evaluate the model's assumptions (normality of residuals, homoscedasticity, etc.).
Model Evaluation

Assess the model's performance using the testing set.
Use metrics such as R-squared, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for evaluation.
Insights and Recommendations

Interpret the model coefficients to understand the impact of each variable on bike demand.
Provide strategic recommendations to BoomBikes based on the model's findings.
This structured approach will ensure a comprehensive analysis, leading to actionable insights for BoomBikes. Let's begin with the first step: Data Cleaning and Preparation.

## General Information
The dataset contains daily data on bike rentals from BoomBikes, including various features such as the date, season, year, month, holiday status, weekday, working status, weather situation, temperature, feeling temperature (atemp), humidity, windspeed, and the counts of casual, registered, and total users (cnt).

The descriptive statistics provide insights into the distribution of numerical features like temperature, humidity, windspeed, and the counts of users. For instance, the average daily count of total bike rentals (cnt) is approximately 4508, with a standard deviation of about 1936, indicating variability in daily rental numbers. The temperature and humidity variables show the expected range of climatic conditions over the period.

This information sets the foundation for further analysis, including cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling to understand the demand dynamics for shared bikes.

## Conclusions
Based on the analysis of the dataset and the modeling of demand for shared bikes, we can draw several conclusions:

Significant Predictors of Demand: The variables identified as significant predictors of bike-sharing demand include weather conditions (temperature, humidity, windspeed), temporal factors (season, month, holiday, weekday), and operational conditions (working day, weather situation). These factors collectively influence the daily usage patterns of the bike-sharing service.

Seasonal and Weather Impact: Demand is significantly affected by the season and weather conditions. Pleasant weather conditions (moderate temperature, low humidity) tend to increase demand, while adverse weather conditions (rain, snow) decrease it. This suggests the importance of weather-adaptive strategies for managing the bike fleet.

Temporal Patterns: The analysis indicates that demand varies across different times of the year, with specific months showing higher usage. Understanding these patterns can help in planning for demand fluctuations.

Strategic Recommendations: To optimize operations and revenue, BoomBikes should consider:

Seasonal Promotions: Target promotions during high-demand seasons and months to attract more users.
Weather Adaptation: Implement weather-adaptive strategies, such as providing weather-appropriate accessories or adjusting the number of bikes available based on the forecast.
Maintenance Scheduling: Schedule maintenance during low-demand periods, identified through adverse weather conditions or specific times of the year.
Market Expansion: Consider expanding to new markets by analyzing demand dynamics similar to the existing market, using the model as a predictive tool.
These conclusions and recommendations can guide BoomBikes in formulating a business strategy to navigate post-pandemic recovery and sustainably grow their operations.
